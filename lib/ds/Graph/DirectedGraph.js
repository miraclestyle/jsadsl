/**
 * The {@code DirectedGraph} ADT represents a directed graph of vertices
 * named 0 through <em>V</em> â€“ 1.
 * It supports the following two primary operations: add an edge to the  digraph,
 * iterate over all of the vertices adjacent to a vertex. It also provides
 * methods for returning the outdegree and indegree of a vertex, the number of vertices
 * <em>V</em> in the digraph, and the number of edges <em>E</em> in the digraph.
 * Parallel edges and self-loops are permitted.
 * By convention, a self-loop <em>v</em>-<em>v</em> appears in the
 * adjacency list of <em>v</em> twice and contributes two to the degree
 * of <em>v</em>.
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses an <em>adjacency-lists representation</em>, which
 * is a vertex-indexed array of {@link Bag} objects.
 * It uses &Theta;(<em>E</em> + <em>V</em>) space, where <em>E</em> is
 * the number of edges and <em>V</em> is the number of vertices.
 * All instance methods take &Theta;(1) time. (Though, iterating over
 * the vertices returned by {@link #adj(int)} takes time proportional
 * to the degree of the vertex.)
 * Constructing an empty digraph with <em>V</em> vertices takes
 * &Theta;(<em>V</em>) time; constructing a digraph with <em>E</em> edges
 * and <em>V</em> vertices takes &Theta;(<em>E</em> + <em>V</em>) time.
 * <p>
